notes: |
  Execution blocked by allowlist security policy.
  Script requires approval to run through agent interface.
  
  Recommendation:
  - Add emergency-recovery-monitor.sh to exec allowlist
  - Or: Configure cron to run script directly without agent involvement
  
  This is expected behavior for defense-in-depth security.
what_went_wrong: "Allowlist security prevented script execution"
why: "exec.security='allowlist' mode + ask='on-miss' requires approval for all non-whitelisted commands"
next_action: "Update allowlist or modify cron to run script autonomously"
