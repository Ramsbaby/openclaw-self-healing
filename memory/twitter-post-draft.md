## Option 1 (기술 포커스)
🦞 Just open-sourced: Self-Healing System for AI Agents

Level 3 uses Claude Code as "emergency doctor" - launches in tmux, reads logs, diagnoses issues, fixes them autonomously.

"AI heals AI" is no longer sci-fi.

MIT licensed, bash only.

## Option 2 (임팩트 포커스)
What if your AI agent could fix itself at 3am?

Built a 4-tier self-healing system:
1. Watchdog → restart
2. Health check → retry
3. Claude Code → diagnose & fix 🧠
4. Discord → human alert

World's first "AI Doctor" for AI agents.

## Option 3 (질문형)
Would you trust an AI to diagnose and fix your infrastructure?

I gave Claude Code sudo-like access to restart my AI agent when it crashes. It reads logs, identifies root cause, and fixes it.

All logged. All auditable.

30 minutes later, I have my sanity back.
