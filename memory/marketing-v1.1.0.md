Title: [Project] OpenClaw Self-Healing - Claude Code as autonomous emergency doctor

Body:
Just released v1.1.0 of a 4-tier self-healing system for OpenClaw Gateway.

The interesting part: Level 3 uses Claude Code running in tmux PTY to autonomously diagnose and repair issues.

- Level 1: Watchdog (process monitoring)
- Level 2: Health Check (HTTP 200)
- Level 3: Claude Recovery (AI diagnosis) ← the fun part
- Level 4: Discord Alert (human escalation)

v1.1.0 adds incident documentation - Claude now logs its reasoning process for each recovery.

Would love feedback on the architecture!
