🦞 I built a self-healing AI system where Claude Code acts as emergency doctor

When my AI agent crashes at 2AM, it now fixes itself.

4-tier recovery:
⚡ Watchdog → Health Check → Claude Doctor → Alert

The AI literally heals itself 🧠

The problem with traditional watchdogs:

❌ Process alive but HTTP dead
❌ Memory fine but API timing out
❌ Config corrupted

They just restart blindly.

My system diagnoses WHY it failed.

## Tweet 3
Level 3 is the magic ✨

Claude Code runs in a tmux PTY session:
• Reads logs
• Checks config
• Identifies root cause
• Attempts repair
• Validates fix

30 min timeout. Fully autonomous.

Results after 2 weeks in production:

📉 Recovery time: 30min → 5min
🌙 Night issues auto-resolved: 90%
👋 Manual fixes: 5/week → 0.5/week
